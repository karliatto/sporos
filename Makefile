## Usage
#
#   $ make build       # compile the firmware
#   $ make flash       # compile, flash, then attach the serial monitor
#   $ make monitor     # attach the serial monitor only
#   $ make check       # type-check without producing a binary
#   $ make test        # run the host tests in crates/core
#   $ make fmt-check   # check formatting in both workspaces
#   $ make clippy      # lint both workspaces, warnings as errors
#   $ make check-reproducible   # prove the build is byte-for-byte reproducible
#
# Requires the espup environment to be sourced first (except for `make test`,
# which builds nothing for the device):
#
#   $ source ~/export-esp.sh

# The firmware is its own workspace, so that .cargo/config.toml -- and with it
# the Xtensa target and build-std -- applies to the device build and not to the
# host tests. Cargo discovers that config from the working directory, not from
# the manifest, so every device target has to `cd` rather than pass
# --manifest-path.

ELF := $(FIRMWARE)/target/xtensa-esp32-none-elf/$(PROFILE)/sporos

# Pins the build timestamp in the ESP-IDF app descriptor, which is part of the
# flashed image. Without this the descriptor records wall-clock time and no two
# builds ever match. Nix's stdenv already exports this exact value, so inside
# the dev shell it changes nothing; hard-assigning it means builds outside the
# shell land on the same timestamp too.
#
# esp-bootloader-esp-idf 0.5.0 reads the value as microseconds when it is really
# seconds, so the descriptor ends up reading 1970-01-01. Wrong, but fixed, which
# is all reproducibility asks of it.

build:

check:
	cd $(FIRMWARE) && cargo check --$(PROFILE)

# Runs in the root workspace, which has no device target and no build-std, so
# this needs neither the espup environment nor a board.
test:
	cargo test

# Neither `cargo fmt` nor `cargo clippy` crosses a workspace boundary, so both
# have to be run twice or the firmware silently stops being checked. Wrapped in
# targets so CI and a local run cannot drift apart.
fmt-check:
	cargo fmt --check
	cd $(FIRMWARE) && cargo fmt --check

clippy:
	cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
	cd $(FIRMWARE) && cargo clippy --$(PROFILE) -- -D warnings

# `cargo run` invokes espflash via the runner configured in .cargo/config.toml.
flash:
	sudo chown ${USER}:${USER} $(DEVICE)
	cd $(FIRMWARE) && ESPFLASH_PORT=$(DEVICE) cargo run --$(PROFILE)

monitor:
	sudo chown ${USER}:${USER} $(DEVICE)
	espflash monitor --port $(DEVICE) --baud $(BAUDRATE)

clean:
	cargo clean
	cd $(FIRMWARE) && cargo clean

# Builds twice from scratch and compares the flashed image, not the ELF -- the
# .bin espflash produces is what actually reaches the device. Two clean builds,
# so expect a couple of minutes.
#
# This only proves determinism on this machine. The cross-machine guarantee also
# needs the pins flake.nix asserts; see the README.
