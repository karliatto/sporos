# Sporo

Bare-metal (`no_std`) Rust for Sporo firmware runs on: an ESP32 driving an ST7789 TFT.

## Prerequisites

The ESP32 is Xtensa, which upstream `rustc` does not target, so the toolchain
comes from Espressif's fork:

With Nix, the flake installs the pinned toolchain for you:

```bash
nix run .#install-esp-toolchain
nix develop               # checks the versions on entry, sources export-esp.sh
```

Without Nix:

```bash
cargo install espup espflash
espup install \
  --toolchain-version 1.95.0.0 \
  --crosstool-toolchain-version 15.2.0_20250920 \
  --name esp-1.95.0.0
source ~/export-esp.sh    # needed in every shell that builds this
```

`espup install` downloads the forked Rust toolchain (installed under the name
[rust-toolchain.toml](rust-toolchain.toml) selects) and the `xtensa-esp32-elf`
linker. It is a large download the first time. The versions are pinned — see
[Reproducible builds](#reproducible-builds) for why, and what to do when
bumping them.

Inside the Nix dev shell (`nix develop`) the versions are checked on entry, and
the shell refuses to start if they do not match.

[firmware/build.rs](firmware/build.rs) checks for the linker up front, so
forgetting to source `export-esp.sh` gives you a one-line error instead of a wall
of linker failures.

## Layout

Two workspaces, because Cargo applies the target and `build-std` from
`.cargo/config.toml` across a whole workspace:

| Path | Contents |
| ---- | -------- |
| [crates/core/](crates/core/) | What a phrase *means*: the wordlist, the BIP-39 arithmetic, and how coin flips pack into the final word. No chip dependencies, so it builds and tests for the host. |
| [crates/app/](crates/app/) | What a key *does*: the workflows (generate a phrase, XOR two phrases, about), the menu, and which screen comes next. Also chip-free, so whole workflows are walked through on the host rather than by pressing keys on the board. |
| [crates/ui/](crates/ui/) | What the user *sees and presses*: the screens, drawn into any `DrawTarget`, and the keymap every legend is composed from. Also chip-free, so `make test` checks that what they draw lands on the panel. |
| [firmware/](firmware/) | The board: display, keypad scan, button, and the Xtensa build settings in [firmware/.cargo/config.toml](firmware/.cargo/config.toml). It reads inputs, hands them to the app, and draws what comes back. |

Each crate depends only on the ones above it in that table, and the graph is what
keeps the rules honest: `core` cannot name an action, `app` cannot name a key
character, and `firmware` reaches the BIP-39 arithmetic only through `app`.

- What a phrase *means* belongs in `crates/core`.
- What a key *does* belongs in `crates/app`.
- What the user *sees and presses* belongs in `crates/ui`.
- Only `firmware/` needs the board — which is what lets `make test` run with no
  board, no espup environment, and no cross-compilation.

## Where the entropy comes from

Every word but the last is typed; the last is derived. For a 12-word phrase,
eleven words fix 121 of its 128 entropy bits and the remaining seven come from
the user — seven coin flips, entered on the keypad — not from the chip. A
24-word phrase works the same way: twenty-three words fix 253 of 256 bits, and
three coin flips supply the rest. The ESP32 has a hardware RNG and it would do
the job, but a seed generator whose randomness comes out of an opaque block on
the die asks you to trust the one thing a device like this exists not to trust.

Note the scope of that claim: it is seven bits of 128, or three of 256. The
rest are the words *you* chose, and this device cannot tell whether you chose
them well.

## Combining two phrases

The XOR tool takes two phrases you already have — both 12 words, or both 24 —
and combines them into a third. You type each one in full, final word included,
and the device checks its checksum before accepting it: the final word's own
entropy is discarded, so the checksum is the only thing that can tell a mistyped
phrase from a real one.

Every word but the last of the result is the XOR of the two inputs at that
position. The last cannot be, because it carries the checksum over everything
before it — the XOR of two final words is almost never a valid word — so it is
derived the way a generated phrase's is, from coin flips, on the same screen and
with the same counts.

**This is not seed splitting.** Because the final word's entropy comes from
fresh flips rather than from the inputs, the operation is *not reversible*:
XORing the result back against one input does not give you the other. It
produces a new phrase derived from two, and nothing you can use to reconstruct
either of them.

## Build and flash

```bash
make build              # compile
make flash              # compile, flash, and open the serial monitor
make monitor            # serial monitor only
make test               # host tests; needs neither a board nor espup
make flash DEVICE=/dev/ttyUSB0
```

Or drive cargo directly. The device build has to run from `firmware/`, since
Cargo finds `.cargo/config.toml` relative to the working directory rather than
to the manifest:

```bash
cd firmware
cargo build --release
cargo run --release   # flashes via the runner configured in .cargo/config.toml
```

## Reproducible builds

Two people building the same commit **inside the Nix dev shell** get a
byte-identical firmware image, on different machines and under different home
directories. Prove it:

```bash
make check-reproducible   # builds twice from clean, compares the flashed .bin
```

CI runs this on every push, in the same `nix develop` shell, as the `build-nix`
job — so the claim is checked rather than assumed.

The guarantee is scoped to `nix develop`. The toolchain still lives outside the
Nix store — espup puts it in `~/.rustup` and `~/.espressif`, so `flake.lock`
cannot pin it — which is why the shell asserts the versions instead. Building
outside the shell with a different compiler will silently produce a different
image.

### Bumping the toolchain

Four places must move together, or the shell will refuse to start and CI will
fail:

1. `espRustVersion` / `espGccVersion` in [flake.nix](flake.nix) — these feed both
   the shell's assertion and `nix run .#install-esp-toolchain`
2. `channel` in [rust-toolchain.toml](rust-toolchain.toml)
3. `version` / `name` and the pin assertion in the `build` job of
   [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) (the `build-nix` job needs
   no change — it reads the pins from the flake)
4. The plain `espup install` command above, for non-Nix users

Then re-run `espup install` with the new versions and `make check-reproducible`.

## Hardware

Pin assignments mirror the `lilygo_ttgo_tdisplay`. 
The `esp32devkit` environment uses a different display wiring and a different
controller (ILI9163).
