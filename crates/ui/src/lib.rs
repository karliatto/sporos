//! What the user sees and presses: the screens, the look they share, and the
//! keymap that turns printed keys into actions.
//!
//! [`render`] draws whatever `sporo-app` says is showing; the screens behind it
//! hold no state and decide nothing. [`keymap`] is the one place a key character
//! means something, and every legend on the panel is composed from it.
//!
//! Kept apart from the firmware for the same reason [`sporo_core`] is: a screen
//! is generic over its [`DrawTarget`](embedded_graphics::draw_target::DrawTarget)
//! and reads its geometry from `bounding_box`, so nothing here needs a chip and
//! all of it can be drawn into a buffer on the host. Whether a line fits on the
//! panel is then a test rather than something to squint at over a serial cable —
//! see `tests/layout.rs`, and [`best_fit_font`] for the failure it guards.
//!
//! Colours are fixed to [`Rgb565`], matching the panel this is built for. A
//! second panel with a different colour type would mean threading a palette
//! through every screen; there is one panel, so there is one palette.

// `std` only for the test harness; nothing outside `#[cfg(test)]` may use it.
