//! The keypad legend along the bottom of a screen, composed from the keymap.
//!
//! Each screen describes its legend as which actions to offer and what to call
//! them; the key characters come from [`crate::keymap::key`]. Typing the legend
//! out as a literal is what this replaces: a literal restates the binding, and
//! nothing checks the restatement, so a rebinding compiled, passed, and left the
//! panel naming a key that did nothing.
