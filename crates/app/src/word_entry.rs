//! State for the recovery-phrase entry screen.
//!
//! The keypad has no letter keys, so words are spelled out by walking a cursor
//! along the alphabet and confirming one letter at a time:
//!
//! | Action    | Effect                                             |
//! | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
//! | `Left`    | move the cursor to the previous usable letter      |
//! | `Right`   | move the cursor to the next usable letter          |
//! | `Select`  | append the selected letter to the current word     |
//! | `Back`    | delete the last letter, or reopen the last word    |
//! | `Confirm` | accept the current word and start the next one     |
//!
//! Only letters that still lead to a BIP-39 word are usable: `Left` and `Right`
//! skip the rest and `Select` will not add them, so a spelling that matches
//! nothing cannot be typed in the first place. What `Confirm` still has to
//! reject is a prefix several words share — see [`WordEntry::rejected`].
//!
//! Pure state — no display or GPIO — so the screen code can render it and the
//! main loop can drive it without either knowing about the other.
